# Overview of Displays
### By Levi Cheney
This tutorial will be an overview of the different specifications of digital displays. Categories covered in this will include:
- [**Resolution**](#resolution)
- [**Display Panel**](#display-panel)
- [**Aspect Ratio**](#aspect-ratio)
- [**Refresh Rate**](#refresh-rate)
- [**Response Time**](#response-time)
- [**Physical Connections**](#physical-connections)

This is meant for people who have very little prior knowledge of these topics. The pages will explain the basic principles. 
# Resolution
Display resolution is the number of pixels in both dimensions that can be displayed. It is typically shown as *width x height*.
Displays can have different ratios, but the resolutions below are all 16:9 Aspect Ratio
### HD
- A **High Definition** display has the resolution of *1280 x 720* pixels
- Sometimes referred to as 720p.
### FHD
- A **Full High Definition** display has the resolution of *1920 x 1080* pixels
- Sometimes referred to as 1080p. 
- Many home televisions were created with this resolution until 4K started to become more popular. 
### QHD
A **Quad High Definition** display has the resolution of *2560 x 1440* pixels
- Sometimes referred to as 1440p
- QHD has four times the amount of pixels of standard HD
### 4K
- A **4K** display has the resolution of *3840 x 2160* pixels
- 4K has some inconsistencies because there are different 4K resolutions.
  - DCI 4K is full 4K resolution used in cinema
  - Ultra-high definition (UHD) is used for many televisions 
- Multiple 4K resolutions were needed because of the aspect ratio of home TVs
  - A standard home TV has an aspect ratio of 16:9
  - A theater has an aspect ratio of 1.90:1 
### 8K
- An **8K** display has the resolution of *7680 x 4320* pixels
- Has 16 times more pixels than FHD
# Display Panel
### Plasma Display
- Use small cells containing plasma that responds to electric fields
- First large TV to be released to the public
- In 2014 the US discontinued the manufacturing of plasma displays

### Liquid Crytal Display (LCD)
- Caused the discontinuation of plasma TVs
- Has a backlight that provides light to individual pixels arranged in a rectangular grid
- A light diffuser is placed between the backlight and the LCD screen
- Each pixel has a red, green, and blue subpixel that can be turned on or off

### Light Emitting Diode Display (LED)
- Uses an array of LED lights  to produce the display
- Low energy consumption allows it to be used in many moble devices
- Provide greater light intensity than LCD

An example of an LED backlight:

### Organic Light Emitting Diode Display (OLED)
- Are able to produce light and color from a single diode
- This means they do not require a separate backlight
- Each pixel can be turned on and off individually allowing for deeper blacks

A comparison between a LCD TV and an OLED TV:

# Aspect Ratio
The aspect ratio is the relationship of the width and height of the screen. It is typically shown as two numbers with a colon in the middle.
The standard aspect ratio
### 1.66:1
The aspect ratio typically used in European theaters
### 16:9
The standard aspect ratio for HD videos
### 1.85:1
The standard aspect ratio used in modern U.S theaters
### 2.39:1
The aspect ratio of wide-screen theater films
Here is a visual example of the comparisons

# Refresh Rate
- The number of times an image is diplayed per second 
- This is typically measured in hertz
- The most common refresh rates are 60Hz, 75Hz, 144Hz, and 240Hz


# Response time
- The amount of time a pixel in a display takes to change
- Measured in milliseconds (ms) 
- Lower numbers mean faster transitions


# Physical Connections
